                        Responsive web design ensures that websites look and function well on a variety of devices, from desktops to mobile
                        phones. Modern techniques like media queries, Flexbox, and Grid help in building layouts that adapt seamlessly. Here are
                        key concepts:

                    <h3>What are Media Queries?</h3>
                    Media queries are CSS rules that apply styles based on the device’s characteristics, such as screen size, orientation,
                    or resolution. They allow developers to create different styles for various devices. A common example:
                    
                    <br/> 
                    <pre>
                    @media (max-width: 768px) {
                    body {
                    font-size: 14px;
                    }
                    }</pre>
                    This rule applies smaller text when the screen width is less than 768 pixels, making the page more readable on mobile
                    devices.
                    
                    <h3>Using Flexbox and Grid for Responsive Design</h3>
                    Flexbox: Flexbox is great for creating one-dimensional layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. It allows you to
                    easily manage spacing, alignment, and the order of elements. For example, items can automatically wrap into multiple
                    rows on smaller screens with flex-wrap: wrap.
                    
                    CSS Grid: Grid is ideal for two-dimensional layouts. You can create responsive grids by defining columns and rows that
                    adjust to the available space, making it easier to design complex, responsive layouts.

                    <h3>Mobile-First Design</h3>
                    A mobile-first approach involves designing the website for small screens first and then using media queries to adjust
                    for larger devices. This ensures that mobile users get an optimal experience. Key elements include larger touch targets,
                    simplified navigation, and avoiding horizontal scrolling.
                    
                    <h3>Best Practices for Responsive Design</h3>
                    Fluid Layouts: Use percentage-based widths rather than fixed pixel values, allowing elements to scale fluidly with
                    screen size.
                    Responsive Images: Use the srcset attribute to load appropriately sized images for different devices, reducing load
                    times.
                    Viewport Meta Tag: Ensure the website scales correctly on mobile with the following meta tag:
                <br/>
                   
                    'meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"'
                    <br/>
                    These techniques help create websites that are visually appealing and functional across a wide range of devices.
